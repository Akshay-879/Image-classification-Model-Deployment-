# Image-classification-Model-Deployment

## Description 

This project involves developing a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for classifying images of dogs and cats. The model is trained using a large dataset of labeled images and optimized using various techniques, such as data augmentation and regularization.

Once the model is trained and tested for accuracy, it is deployed using Flask, a Python-based web framework, to provide a web-based interface for users to upload and classify their own images. The web interface is developed using HTML and CSS to create an intuitive and user-friendly experience.

The project requires expertise in deep learning and computer vision techniques, as well as web development skills to deploy the model using Flask and create the user interface using HTML and CSS. The final output of the project is a functional web application that can accurately classify images of dogs and cats, with potential applications in various fields such as animal welfare and surveillance.
