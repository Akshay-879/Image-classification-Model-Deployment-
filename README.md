# Image Classification Model Deployment


## Business Understanding:
The goal of this project is to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that can accurately classify images of dogs and cats. By training the model with a labeled dataset and utilizing techniques such as data augmentation and regularization, we aim to achieve high accuracy in image classification. The final outcome is a web-based application that allows users to upload their own images for classification, with potential applications in areas like animal welfare and surveillance.

## Approach:
#### To solve the business problem, we followed these steps:

1. Dataset preparation: Gathered a large dataset of labeled images of dogs and cats.
2. Model development: Developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using deep learning and computer vision techniques.
3. Model optimization: Utilized various techniques, including data augmentation and regularization, to improve the model's performance.
4. Model testing: Evaluated the trained model's accuracy and made necessary adjustments for improvement.
5. Web deployment: Utilized Flask, a Python-based web framework, to deploy the trained model. Created an intuitive and user-friendly web interface using HTML and CSS.
